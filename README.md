This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6).

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image (in my solution lightbox is availible only with screenwidth > 750px)
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

This solution is adaptive for the screenwidth of most of the mobile gadgets. Check it on Github pages, any feedback is highly appreciated.
